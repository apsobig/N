    <h2>Moments I Treasure</h2>
    
<p><strong>Watching Fear Street 2</strong><br>
  I held you and Rimsha close, and for a moment, it felt like a home I never knew I needed. Like family. Like peace.</p>

  <p><strong>Your eyes, that night</strong><br>
  I looked at them, by mistake. Was a glance, but turned into a stare. It wasn't just admiration, but the kind of look that realizes. The look that made me realise you're the one.</p>
  <img src="C:\Users\Archett Patil\Desktop\Udemy Course Resources\N\P2.jpg" alt="Looking into her eyes" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
  
  <p><strong>The walk that changed it all</strong><br>
  I never thought an hour could alter my feelings towards someone in such a drastic way. That morning was the final seal on the fact that I belonged to you and only you.</p>

    <h2>Reasons I Love You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The care and love you’ve shown me in such a short time, it's directed me towards something meaningful.</li>
      <li>Your beautiful, beautiful mind, so deep, so thoughtful. It hasn’t just made me love you more, it's made my respect for you increase to a level which words couldn't ever encapsulate.</li>
      <li>Your smile, it makes my heart go :(( Every. Single. Time.</li>
      <li>You let me in, even after all you’ve been through. That trust? I’ll treasure it forever, vowing to never do anything to make it change.</li>
      <li>You took the first step toward “us”, and I thank you for that every day.</li>
      <li>You made me feel safe in someone's arms again, made me realise that not everyone is the same.</li>
      <li>You always tell me the truth, even when it’s hard, and that makes me admire you tenfold.</li>
      <li>You brought stability to my chaotic and uneven life, it's like you anchored a ship that could never stay still.</li>
      <li>You made me want to be better — not for the world, but for you.</li>
    </ul>
